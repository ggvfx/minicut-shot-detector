"""
SMPTE Timecode Engine.

The only place in the project where frames become time. Everything else works
in integer frames and calls in here at output boundaries — sidecar fields, UI
labels, ffmpeg arguments.

Frame rate mistakes (23.976 against 24) and off-by-one errors are the failure
this project is most exposed to, so the arithmetic is isolated here where it
can be unit tested on its own.

Two ideas are easy to confuse and are kept strictly apart:

- **Frames** are real pictures. Frame 1798 is the 1799th picture in the file.
- **Labels** are what timecode counts. At 29.97 drop-frame, some labels are
  never used, so the label count runs ahead of the frame count by design.
