FFmpeg Toolchain.

Every call to ffmpeg and ffprobe in the project goes through this class. They
are invoked as subprocesses, never through a Python binding, so the exact
binary and version can be recorded in the job sidecar.

Lives in core rather than media because everything depends on it and it depends
on nothing — the environment checks need it before any media module is touched.
