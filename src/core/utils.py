"""
Shared Utility Functions.

**Used by both tabs.** Small helpers needed in more than one module. Anything
here must depend on nothing but the standard library — this is the bottom of
the dependency chain, and everything else is free to import it.

If a helper is only used by one module, it belongs in that module instead. One
file for now; split it per-package only when there is a concrete reason, and
say what the reason is at the time.
