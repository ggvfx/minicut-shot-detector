"""
Review Proxy Creation.

Builds the small video the browser plays while boundaries are reviewed.

Why a proxy rather than the source: browsers seek long-GOP h264 and h265
approximately, landing near a frame rather than on it, and Chrome plays h265
only where the hardware allows. Neither is acceptable when the whole point is
knowing exactly which frame you are looking at.

The proxy is all-intra h264 at a small size, so every frame is a keyframe,
seeking is exact and instant, and it plays in any browser. It is built from the
mezzanine, which has already been verified frame-for-frame against the source,
so frame N of the proxy is provably frame N of what will be cut.

Each frame carries its own number burned into the corner. That turns the one
real risk — the player's idea of the current frame drifting from the picture —
into something a person can see rather than something they have to trust.

            the entire output with "Filter not found", so no proxy is built and
